# _CAESAR CIPHER ENCRYPTION AND DECRYPTION_

-Overview

The Caesar Cipher is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This method was named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

-How It Works

The Caesar Cipher works by shifting the position of each letter in the plaintext by a fixed number of places determined by the shift value. For example, with a shift of 3:

A becomes D

B becomes E

C becomes F

and so on...

If the shift moves past the end of the alphabet, it wraps around to the beginning. For example, with a shift of 3:

X becomes A

Y becomes B

Z becomes C

The same shift value used for encryption can be used in reverse to decrypt the message.

-Features

Encrypt Text: Convert plaintext into ciphertext by shifting the characters.

Decrypt Text: Convert ciphertext back into plaintext using the same shift value.

Case Sensitivity: Maintains the case of the original text (i.e., uppercase and lowercase letters are treated separately).

Non-alphabetic Characters: Leaves non-alphabetic characters (e.g., spaces, punctuation) unchanged.

-How to Use

Encrypt a Message:

Input the message you want to encrypt.

Provide a shift value (integer) to determine the number of positions each character will be shifted.

The program outputs the encrypted message.

Decrypt a Message:

Input the message you want to decrypt.

Provide the same shift value used for encryption.

The program outputs the decrypted message.
